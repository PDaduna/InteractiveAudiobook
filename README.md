# Interactive Multiplayer Audio Book

Orientation-Project


## Description

The concept of this project is to create a multiplayer experience, where the users are able to decide which way they want to go. This experience is known from the traditional Pen & Paper, books (e.g. "Insel der 1000 Gefahren"), movies (e.g. "Black Mirror - Bandersnatch") or games (e.g. "Until Dawn" or traditional text-adventure like "Zork").

My intention is to bring this experience to a new medium - an audiobook. I want to combine the multiplayer aspect and non-linear storytelling of the Pen & Paper roleplay game with a digital component. 

The idea is that 4 people can sit together with their phones and connect the phones to a server, which will be hosted on a Raspberry Pie, to start the game. A Narrator will tell the story and will guide them through the game. Players will have options to choose from, for example, to walk "through the door" or "through the corridor" or what item to take. These decisions will have an impact on the story. So if the players don't get the right clues, they will not reach the end or will experience a different ending.

The technical challenges of this project will be to set up a server with a Raspberry Pie to host the web application. This Raspberry Pie will act like a "Play-Box", so the users are flexible where they want to play the story. This makes it possible for example to start the story at home, keep playing on a long train ride and finish to play where they want and when they want.
